- ðŸ‘‹  - Hi, Iâ€™m Oghenekome Akaka. Calling me Kome is fine but you get extra points for correctly calling my full name ðŸ¥° .
- ðŸ‘€  - Iâ€™m interested in continuous learning, collaborating, internships, scholarships, front end development entry/junior level jobs, growth, happiness and peace.
- ðŸŒ±  - Iâ€™m currently learning to create projects on my own while utilizing Javascript data types (especially Arrays and Objects), conditional statements, loops, functions and (but not limited to) local storage. I am also taking some online challenges for Javascript and frontend development in general. Once I feel a certain level of comfort and confidence using the Javascript language, I'll be learning React or Angular or both (still not decided. We'll see ðŸ¤” ).
- ðŸ“«  - Reach me easily via email to oghenekomeakaka@gmail.com or luciakome@gmail.com. You can also tweet at me @ogheneekome
